# Pig-E.-Bank
I used Python to wrangle and analyze several datasets for Instacart. I then created a report that communicates my analysis process and my results and recommendations to key business questions from Pig E. Bank.

##  Objective
![Pig E  Bank Logo-cropped](https://github.com/DawnChism/Pig-E.-Bank/assets/157734176/e4e9db5b-41dc-44ae-bd17-4e0e4f1212fa)

One of the data analysts for the sales team recently left Pig E. Bank, so I’ve agreed to take their place and help out with a customer retention project.

## Goal
Identify the top risk factors that contribute to client loss and model them in a decision tree.

## Data
Pig E. Bank's Data Set - This dataset was created by CareerFoundry for use in this analysis. The data set includes customer ids, last names, credit scores, country, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, if they have a credit card, if they are an active member, estimated salary, and if they have exited from the bank. 

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:

● Pandas: for data analysis

● Numpy: for mathematical equations

## Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:

● 01 Project Management: Project Brief

● 02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frame and the data frame after it has been cleaned and prepared for analysis. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub.)

● 03 Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.

● 04 Analysis: Contains the subfolder Visualizations which contains the decision tree.

● 05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel.

## Visualizations
The decision tree was created using Canva and may be viewed in the attached [Canva Whiteboard](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF6WZpQH2M/z-5dphFqDTF96lBh3qRzZg/view?utm_content=DAF6WZpQH2M&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor).

All other visualizations were created in the attached Excel Workbook.
